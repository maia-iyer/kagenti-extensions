# Multi-Target Demo Routes Configuration
#
# Each route maps a destination host to token exchange parameters.
# Order matters - first match wins.

# Target Alpha - matches both short name and FQDN
- host: "target-alpha-service**"
  target_audience: "target-alpha"
  token_scopes: "openid target-alpha-aud"

# Target Beta - matches both short name and FQDN
- host: "target-beta-service**"
  target_audience: "target-beta"
  token_scopes: "openid target-beta-aud"

# Target Gamma - matches both short name and FQDN
- host: "target-gamma-service**"
  target_audience: "target-gamma"
  token_scopes: "openid target-gamma-aud"

# Wildcard example - any service in internal namespace skips exchange
# - host: "*.internal.svc.cluster.local"
#   passthrough: true
