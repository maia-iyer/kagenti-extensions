# AuthProxy iptables initialization — Istio ambient mesh coexistence
#
# This script sets up iptables rules for the AuthProxy Envoy sidecar to intercept
# outbound traffic (for token injection) and inbound traffic (for JWT validation).
# It is designed to coexist with Istio's ambient mesh ztunnel inside the same pod
# network namespace.
#
# ─── Background ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Istio ambient mesh runs a ztunnel DaemonSet that holds in-pod sockets inside
# each enrolled pod's netns, listening on:
#   15001 — outbound traffic capture
#   15006 — inbound plaintext delivery
#   15008 — HBONE (mTLS tunneling)
#   15053 — DNS proxy
#
# ztunnel runs as UID 0, GID 1337, and sets fwmark 0x539 on its sockets.
#
# Istio's CNI agent installs its own iptables rules in the pod netns:
#   nat OUTPUT:      ISTIO_OUTPUT  (redirects outbound to ztunnel 15001)
#   nat PREROUTING:  ISTIO_PRERT  (redirects inbound to ztunnel 15006)
#   mangle:          connmark tracking (0x111 for return traffic)
#
# ─── Chain ordering ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# This script uses -I (insert at position 1) so our chains always run BEFORE
# Istio's chains, which use -A (append). The resulting order is:
#
#   nat OUTPUT:     1. PROXY_OUTPUT   (ours)
#                   2. ISTIO_OUTPUT   (Istio's)
#
#   nat PREROUTING: 1. PROXY_INBOUND (ours)
#                   2. ISTIO_PRERT   (Istio's)
#
#   mangle OUTPUT:  1. our MARK rule
#                   2. ISTIO_OUTPUT   (Istio's connmark restore)
#
# This ordering is stable regardless of timing because:
#   - Kubernetes runs CNI plugins before init containers
#   - Istio CNI agent sets up ambient rules asynchronously (pod event watch)
#   - Both use -A (append); we use -I 1 (insert first) — so our rules land first
#     whether Istio's rules exist yet or not
#
# ─── Outbound flow (app → external service) ──────────────────────────────────
#
# Without ambient mesh:
#   1. App connects to ClusterIP:port
#   2. PROXY_OUTPUT catches → REDIRECT to Envoy outbound (15123)
#   3. Envoy ext_proc injects auth token
#   4. Envoy connects to original destination (original_dst cluster)
#   5. PROXY_OUTPUT: UID 1337 → RETURN (skip our rules)
#   6. Packet exits pod → kube-proxy DNAT → target pod
#
# With ambient mesh:
#   Steps 1-5 same as above, then:
#   6. ISTIO_OUTPUT catches (mark != 0x539) → REDIRECT to ztunnel (15001)
#   7. ztunnel wraps in HBONE (mTLS) → target pod's ztunnel
#   8. Target ztunnel delivers plaintext to target app
#
# Key interaction: Envoy's outbound connection (UID 1337) RETURNs from
# PROXY_OUTPUT and falls through to ISTIO_OUTPUT, which redirects to ztunnel.
# This is intentional — ztunnel provides mTLS for the connection.
#
# ─── Inbound flow (external → app in this pod) ──────────────────────────────
#
# Without ambient mesh (traffic arrives via network):
#   1. Packet arrives at pod → PREROUTING
#   2. PROXY_INBOUND catches → REDIRECT to Envoy inbound (15124)
#   3. Envoy ext_proc validates JWT
#   4. Envoy connects to original destination (app port) via original_dst cluster
#   5. App receives request
#
# With ambient mesh (traffic arrives via HBONE):
#   1. Source ztunnel sends HBONE to this pod's ztunnel (port 15008)
#   2. ztunnel terminates mTLS, delivers plaintext to local app
#   3. Delivery goes through OUTPUT chain (ztunnel uses in-pod socket)
#      - ztunnel preserves original client IP as source (IP_TRANSPARENT)
#      - ztunnel's socket has fwmark 0x539; ztunnel runs as UID 0
#   4. PROXY_OUTPUT mark-based rule matches:
#        mark=0x539, UID!=1337, dst-type=LOCAL → REDIRECT to Envoy inbound (15124)
#   5. Envoy ext_proc validates JWT
#   6. Envoy (UID 1337) connects to original destination (app port)
#      - mangle OUTPUT sets mark 0x539 (UID 1337 + dst-type LOCAL)
#      - PROXY_OUTPUT rule 1: mark ✓ but UID IS 1337 → skip
#      - PROXY_OUTPUT rule 2: mark 0x539 → RETURN
#      - ISTIO_OUTPUT: sees mark 0x539 → ACCEPT
#   7. App receives request
#
# Key interactions:
#   - The mark-based rule (step 4) MUST use --dst-type LOCAL. Without it, ztunnel's
#     outbound HBONE connections (to remote pod IPs, also mark 0x539, also UID!=1337)
#     would match and get redirected to the inbound listener, causing
#     InvalidContentType errors (Envoy speaks HTTP, ztunnel expects mTLS).
#   - route_localnet=1 is required because REDIRECT in OUTPUT changes dst to 127.0.0.1,
#     but ztunnel's delivery has a non-local source IP (original client). Without
#     route_localnet, the kernel treats 127.0.0.1 as martian during re-routing after
#     NAT and silently drops the SYN (visible as OutNoRoutes in /proc/net/snmp).
#   - The mangle rule (step 6) prevents a loop: without mark 0x539, ISTIO_OUTPUT would
#     redirect Envoy's local delivery back to ztunnel (15001). Mangle OUTPUT runs
#     before nat OUTPUT in the netfilter hook ordering.
#
# ─── Debugging tips ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   conntrack -L               — shows actual REDIRECT targets and connection states
#   /proc/net/snmp OutNoRoutes — reveals routing failures (route_localnet issue)
#   iptables-legacy-save       — both Istio and AuthProxy use iptables-legacy
#   curl 127.0.0.1:9901/stats  — Envoy listener/cluster stats
#   ztunnel logs               — connections logged only on completion, not start

# When ambient mesh is active, ztunnel terminates inbound HBONE and delivers
# plaintext to the local app via its in-pod socket. This delivery goes through
# the OUTPUT chain (not PREROUTING) because ztunnel creates a new local connection
# from within the pod netns.
#
# We match on three criteria to identify this traffic:
#   mark 0x539  — ztunnel sets this fwmark on all its sockets
#   UID != 1337 — excludes our own Envoy (which also gets 0x539 via mangle below)
#   dst-type LOCAL — only local delivery (to app in this pod)
#
# The --dst-type LOCAL constraint is critical: ztunnel uses mark 0x539 for BOTH
# its inbound delivery (dst = local app port) AND its outbound HBONE connections
# (dst = remote pod IP on port 15008). Without --dst-type LOCAL, outbound HBONE
# would be hijacked into the inbound listener, where Envoy speaks plain HTTP
# back to ztunnel which expects mTLS — producing InvalidContentType errors.

# After rule 1 captured ztunnel's inbound delivery, any other ztunnel traffic
# (outbound HBONE, DNS proxy, etc.) must pass through unmodified. Matching on
# fwmark 0x539 is more robust than excluding individual port numbers — it covers
# all ztunnel sockets (15001, 15006, 15008, 15053, and any future ports).

# --- Mangle rule: prevent Envoy→app loop through ISTIO_OUTPUT ---
# After inbound JWT validation, Envoy (UID 1337) connects to the local app.
# Without this mark, ISTIO_OUTPUT would see mark != 0x539 and redirect Envoy's
# local connection to ztunnel (port 15001), creating an infinite loop:
#   Envoy → ISTIO_OUTPUT → ztunnel 15001 → HBONE to self → ztunnel 15008 → ...
#

# this traffic, and ISTIO_OUTPUT's loopback rule (!dst 127.0.0.1 + -o lo → ACCEPT)
# lets it through to the app.
#
# This rule is in the mangle table because mangle OUTPUT runs before nat OUTPUT
# in netfilter hook ordering, so the mark is set before ISTIO_OUTPUT evaluates it.
#
# The --dst-type LOCAL constraint ensures we only mark Envoy's local delivery
# (to the app in this pod), not Envoy's outbound connections to external services.
